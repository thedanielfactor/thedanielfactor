## 🧠 Who Am I?

With nearly 30 years in software development, I’ve built, broken, and reimagined more systems than I care to count. I’m the kind of engineer who:

- Thrives on solving hard problems (bonus points if they’re weird and no one else wants ‘em).
- Loves learning new tech and teaching it to others.
- Will dig into a GraphQL resolver, an AWS CDK stack, and a tailwind config

> ⚠️ Caution: prone to sarcasm, coffee-fueled debugging, and mid-sentence refactors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Highlights

```ts
const stack = {
  frontend: ["React", "TypeScript", "Next.js", "Tailwind"],
  backend: [
    "TypeScript",
    "Node.js",
    "GraphQL",
    "Java",
    "MongoDB",
    "AWS (CDK, Lambda, SQS, SNS, OpenSearch)",
  ],
  tools: ["Postman", "Docker", "GitHub Actions", "Jest", "Storybook"],
};
```
